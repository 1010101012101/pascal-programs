Specular Highlighting with Spherical Environment mapping
--------------------------------------------------------

This little project uses specular highlighting on a textured object. 
The object has a spherical environment textrure applied to it.
The is one light source and the material has a very reflective surface.

You can enable and disable lighting to see the effect that lighting has
on the object. On GeForce based cards there doesnt seem to be much of 
as performance difference, but on earlier cards the frame rate improves
by almost 20% if lighting is disabled. 

The model is a 3DS model that I got somewhere and then converted it to
an ascii format.

Keys :
 - L : Enables and Disable lights.
Mouse : 
 - Leftbutton : rotates the ship
 - Rightbutton : zoom in and out
