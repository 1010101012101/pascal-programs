# pascal-programs
This repo. contains an array of Pascal programs which were written during the years 2000-2002 and represent class assingnments and also the final project assignment. The programs were written all on a Win. XP OS. Since Win. XP is legacy I also provide some of the .exe files of the programs. The final project can be run on an Win. XP OS. I did no tests on newer OSs. You are free to try if the provided .exe files will run on new OS versions. For those of you who are not familiar with Pascal, please check here:

# Folder Contents
1.Final Poject:
Contains the final project written completly in Pascal. It is composed of eight other sub-programs which
display different capabilities of the Pascal prog. language. The report folder contanins the description of the code. For those of you who can not read it I am willing to help out.

2.IDE:
Contains an IDE which can be used to develop Pascal programs.

3.Pascal Compilers:
A series of Pascal compilers which I've tried in order to find the best suited for me.

4.programs1:
Contains several easy to solve Pascal programs.

5.programs2:
Contains other easy to solve Pascal programs.

6.programs3:
Contains some medium to solve Pascal programs.

7.programs4:
Contains some medium to hard to solve Pascal programs.

8.programs5:
Contains some hard to solve Pascal programs.

# Build/Install
In order to build/compile each Pascal program the TMT compiler is recommanded. This is also available in the 
Pascal compilers folder. At the end of the compilation an .exe file can be generated that can be run on an Win. XP or any compatible OS.
