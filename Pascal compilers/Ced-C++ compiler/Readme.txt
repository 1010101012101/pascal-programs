		C++ Editor for Windows9x/NT/2000/XP

		Product description

The C++ Editor is a text editor for C++ programmers. The editor have 
color syntax highlighting. Editor's main purpose is to edit source 
code files outside the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with 
multiple opened copies of program, when programmer needs to find, 
replace or compare source code. The program can compile the file 
using for this purpose the Microsoft VC compiler. Most effectively 
the editor can be used with a file search utility. The search utility 
Search&Edit or IDE Helper is available for download on developer's 
WEB site (http://www.ua1zcl.com/dwnl_frame.htm).

		Installation

Run Setup.exe and choose there an installation folder. On Windows95 the 
setup program may not work if the operating system was not updated with 
MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or later releases, then the setup program will 
ask you for Windows 95 OSR2 distribution disk to find some of libraries.
		Important
Several IDEs (MSVC, BC++) not understand files path containing spaces, 
therefore, please install C++ Editor to another than default 
(Program Files) path, otherwise a file transfer to the IDE will fail.
Good luck!
