                                  TMTPACK

TMTPACK is a packer for TMT Pascal executables. It has a good compression
ratio.   Also it hide internal body of program to prevent unwanted
modifications.

Version 0.2b has an improved compression ratio because of the preliminary
processing code and relocations of the packed program and the advantage of
the new APLIB.

The packer works with any version of TMT Pascal for DOS.
It no longer needs the special stub tmt32.exe instead of the beta version.
However the tmt32 stub is smaller and therefore a program packed with it is
smaller than one packed with the beta version.
The packed program may use any stub.

For safety the original program is now renamed with the extension, "OLD".


                             Version 0.3b
                             
Slightly improved compression ratio because the E8 optimization is changed
and the coding is improved.

If it is desired, we can put built-in TMTPACK binding/unbinding
of any stub from program without recompilation in the next version.
